I have two list of objects, list_A and list_B, I want to return a list named uncover which find items in list_B doesn't appear in list_A, 
sometimes same object can be expressed in different ways in list_A and list_B, we treat different expression but similar meaning objects as matched, not include in mistmatch list.

For example
list_A = ['two cars', 'dark bagpack', 'yellow jacket', 'light', 'brick building', 'wood chair', 'chair', 'green car', 'dining room table', 'bike', 'city street', 'traffic light', 'sedan']
list_B = ['reflection of light', 'view of office building', 'street chair', 'white car', 'red car', 'dark hair']

Answer:
uncover = ['reflection of light', 'dark hair']

In this example
'reflection of light' cannot find matched object in list_A, especially, 'light' is not equal to 'reflection of light'.
'view of office building' in list_B can find matched object 'brick building' although they are not exactly same but they point to similar object.
'street chair' in list_B can find 'chair', 'wood chair' in list_A which is an alternate expression of 'chair'.
'white car' in list_B can find 'two cars' in list_A.
'red car' in list_B can find 'two cars' in list_A.
'dark hair' in list_B cannot find anything similar in list_A

Another example
list_A = ['bag', 'cloth', 'boy', 'Drinking glasses', 'table']
list_B =['backpack', 'jacket', 'young man', 'cup', 'kitchen table', 'plate', 'apple']
Answer:
uncover = ['plate', 'apple']

In this example, 
'backpack' in list_B can find 'bag' in list_A has similar meaning, matched.
'jacket' in list_B can be seen as a kind of 'cloth' in list_A still matching;
'young man' in list_B can match 'boy' in list_A;
'cup' in list_B is similar to 'Drinking glasses' in list_A;
'kitchen table' is a kind of table as 'table' in list_A so there is no uncovered items.
'plate' in list_B but no object has same or similar meaning in list_A.
'apple' in list_B but no object has same or similar meaning in list_A.

Another example
list_A = ['keyboard', 'mouse', 'moniter', 'cpu']
list_B = ['computer']
Answer:
uncover = []
'computer' in list_B can find 'keyboard', 'mouse', 'moniter', 'cpu' as whole thing in list_A, matched.

Here is the inputs
list_A = {cap_obj}
list_B = {gt}
Answer:
uncover =
